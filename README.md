# Project setup

After `flutter pub get` run `dart run husky install` to configure the git hooks.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are injected at build time via `--dart-define-from-file`. Create a `.env.json` file in the project root with the following keys:

```json
{
  "KEYS_URL": "<url to the encrypted keys file>",
  "KEYS_DECRYPTION_KEY": "<32-char AES key for the keys file>",
  "SOCIAL_LINKS_URL": "<url to the social links JSON endpoint>",
  "UPLOAD_KEYS_URL": "<url to the key upload endpoint>",
  "ANNOUNCEMENTS_URL": "<url to the announcements JSON endpoint>",
  "UPDATE_URL": "<url to the update JSON endpoint>"
}
```

Pass it to every build/run command:

```
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env.json
flutter build <target> --dart-define-from-file=.env.json
```

> **VS Code**: `.vscode/launch.json` already includes `"toolArgs": ["--dart-define-from-file=.env.json"]` in every configuration, so the flag is applied automatically when launching from the editor.

| Key | Used in |
|---|---|
| `KEYS_URL` | `lib/services/key_service.dart` |
| `KEYS_DECRYPTION_KEY` | `lib/services/key_service.dart` |
| `SOCIAL_LINKS_URL` | `lib/services/social_link.dart` |
| `UPLOAD_KEYS_URL` | `lib/services/upload_keys.dart` |
| `ANNOUNCEMENTS_URL` | `lib/services/announcements_service.dart` |
| `UPDATE_URL` | `lib/services/app_update_service.dart` |
